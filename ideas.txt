Carlos:
Happy birthday Eko! You're such a cool unique person. Your tiny voice to your awesome art. Your ddr skills don't stop getting better and you don't quit. I can't wait to see what you become because I know it'll be great! Thank you for the super cool cat. I'll keep it as long as it doesn't deteriorate. Have a great year! ðŸ˜Š
